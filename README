Program to calibrate ensemble precipitation forecasts from ECMWF's eps25 files

Intended usage:
   cp rawFile.nc newFile.nc
   ./precipCal rawFile.nc parameters.txt newFile.nc

Notes
* When reading the input file, all missing values are converted to the internal missing flag indicator. When
  writing to the output file, these missing values are written back as the missing flag indicator of the
  output file.
* If an ensemble has one or more missing members (where an ensemble is for a specific gridpoint and time),
  the ensemble is not calibrated, and the original values are used instead.
* Files with accumulation fields are automatically deaccumulated.
* Negative precipitation amounts are automatically set to 0.
