Framework for post-processing gridded forecasts

./postprocess.exe <inputFile> <outputFile> -v variable -d downscaler -c calibrator -v variable2 -downscaler -c calibrator

Basic principles:
* If the calibration goes terrible, revert to the raw values
* When methods read parameters, they should fail early

Notes
* When reading the input file, all missing values are converted to the internal missing flag indicator. When
  writing to the output file, these missing values are written back as the missing flag indicator of the
  output file.
* If an ensemble has one or more missing members (where an ensemble is for a specific gridpoint and time),
  the ensemble is not calibrated, and the original values are used instead.
* Files with accumulation fields are automatically deaccumulated.
* Negative precipitation amounts are automatically set to 0.
* If the calibration produces invalid values (infinity, etc), the raw values are used.
* Do not allow operations on raw fields that have been derived to something else.

Software structure
   File: Any object implementing data with x (lat), y (lon), time, and ensemble dimensions.
   Calibrator: Any function that alters variables in a file
   Downscaler: Any function that 

Testing of code
* Unit tests are placed in src/Testing/, one file for each class that is tested.
* Convenient input files for testing are located in testing/files/
* New downscalers and calibrators should produce valid results for testing/files/5x5.nc
